How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
================================

This module defines a text-indentation function ``text_indentation(text)``.

Usage
=====

Text is printed with two new lines after each of the characters ``.``, ``?``,
and ``:``.

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("Hello?")
    Hello?

No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line.

New lines are only printed for the characters ``.``, ``?``, and ``:`` -
text not ending with one of these characters is not ended with a new line.
 
Invalid Text
============

The paramter ``text`` must be a string. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> text_indentation(7)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::

    >>> text_indentation({"one": 1, "two": 2})
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::

    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string
